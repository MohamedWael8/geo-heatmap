# edaplotjs.GeoHeatmap

Demo: https://yenchiah.github.io/geo-heatmap/GeoHeatmap.html

This JavaScript library is for creating an interactive geographical heatmap. This library uses Google map's [data layer](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/layer-data-dynamic) to show GeoJSON zipcode boundaries. These zipcode boundaries are processed and downloaded from [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/zip-codetabilation-area-boundaries/resource/ea476dcb-4846-4242-9fb3-d41afb13bf52). The polygons on the map can be colored by using [d3-scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale). One example that uses this library is the [Environmental Health Channel](https://cmu-create-lab.github.io/ehp-channel/web/visualization.html).
